# Functional Test Plan

1) Test each operator to assure correct behavior

2) Test for exceptions such as divide by zero or digit overflow

3) Try to give each input box bad input and check that this is handled

4) Write automated use cases to verify UI behavior

5) Write test cases for most common use such as for calculating tips at a restaurant.
